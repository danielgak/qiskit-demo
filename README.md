# Qiskit personal demo notes

This is a personal demo with notes using the [Qiskit SDK](https://qiskit.org) following the [Qiskit textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html) to learn the basic concepts of cuantum computing.

To check this tutorial you need to have Python 3 and jupyter installed.


```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Other dependencies will be required to run the Qiskit SDK (specially for rendering graphics). Those you will find in the notebook itself.

You can execute this examples at the [IBMs Quantum Cloud Application](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) and practice your cuantum problem solving skills with [these katas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/tutorials/intro-to-katas)!
